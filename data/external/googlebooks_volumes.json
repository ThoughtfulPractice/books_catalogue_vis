Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment. Today, nine revisions later, the Joy of Cooking\u2014selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century\u2014has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis. Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were \u201cstand facing the stove.\u201d JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales. This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, saut\u00e9, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating\u2014as well as a large dose of common sense. This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza. In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes. This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles\u2014those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes\u2014abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well. As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion\u2014always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY. This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you. Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.

The two biggest challenges in software architecture are keeping architecture \"in sync\" with the requirements as they are uncovered or evolve, and in sync with the implementation as it gets built and evolves.The book starts off by explaining how Python fits into application architecture. Next, you will gain knowledge of architecturally significant requirements and how to determine them. Later, you'll get a complete understanding of the different architectural quality requirements that help an architect to build a product that satisfies business requirements such as Maintainability/Reusability, Testability, Scalability, Performance, Usability, and Security.You will use various techniques such as incorporating DevOps, Continuous Integration, and more to make your application robust. You will understand when and when not to use object-orientation in your applications. You will be able to think into the future and design applications that can scale proportionally to the growing business.The focus is on building the business logic based on the business process documentation, and which frameworks are to be used when. We also cover some important patterns that are to be taken into account while solving design problems, as well as those in relatively new domains such as the cloud.This book will help you understand the ins and outs of Python so that you can make those critical design decisions that not just live up to but surpass the expectations of your clients.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2017-03-31", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=_hjwvQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781786468529&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Software Architecture with Python", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 645, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1786468522", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781786468529", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_hjwvQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_hjwvQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Anand Balachandran Pillai"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Software_Architecture_with_Python.html?hl=&id=_hjwvQAACAAJ", "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=_hjwvQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781786468529&hl=&source=gbs_api", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Architect and design highly scalable, robust, clean, and highly performant applications in PythonAbout This Book* Identify design issues and make the necessary adjustments to achieve improved performance* Understand practical architectural ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "/aY8+/f3MA0", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_hjwvQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "_hjwvQAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_hjwvQAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9781491946008", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "O'Reilly Media", "description": "Python\u2019s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren\u2019t using everything it has to offer.

Giving another person the opportunity to find their own way, make their own mistakes, and create their own wisdom is both brave and vulnerable. It can also mean unlearning our ''fix it'' habits. In this practical and inspiring book, Michael shares seven transformative questions that can make a difference in how we lead and support. And, he guides us through the tricky part - how to take this new information and turn it into habits and a daily practice. -Bren\u00e9 Brown, author of Rising Strong and Daring Greatly Drawing on years of experience training more than 10,000 busy managers from around the globe in practical, everyday coaching skills, Bungay Stanier reveals how to unlock your peoples' potential. He unpacks seven essential coaching questions to demonstrate how---by saying less and asking more--you can develop coaching methods that produce great results. - Get straight to the point in any conversation with The Kickstart Question - Stay on track during any interaction with The AWE Question - Save hours of time for yourself with The Lazy Question, and hours of time for others with The Strategic Question - Get to the heart of any interpersonal or external challenge with The Focus Question and The Foundation Question - Finally, ensure others find your coaching as beneficial as you do with The Learning Question A fresh, innovative take on the traditional how-to manual, the book combines insider information with research based in neuroscience and behavioural economics, together with interactive training tools to turn practical advice into practiced habits. Dynamic question-and-answer sections help identify old habits and kick-start new behaviour, making sure you get the most out of all seven chapters. Witty and conversational, The Coaching Habit takes your work--and your workplace--from good to great.", "publishedDate": "2016-02-29", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGFPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGFPDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Michael Bungay Stanier"], "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "publisher": "Box of Crayons Press", "language": "en", "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "allowAnonLogging": true, "title": "The Coaching Habit", "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "averageRating": 3.5, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=EGFPDAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:9780978440749&hl=&source=gbs_api", "ratingsCount": 2}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "- Get straight to the point in any conversation with The Kickstart Question - Stay on track during any interaction with The AWE Question - Save hours of time for yourself with The Lazy Question, and hours of time for others with The ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "XShFtbusCiA", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EGFPDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": true, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books/download/The_Coaching_Habit-sample-pdf.acsm?id=EGFPDAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "PARTIAL", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books/download/The_Coaching_Habit-sample-epub.acsm?id=EGFPDAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE"}, "id": "EGFPDAAAQBAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EGFPDAAAQBAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9781473658127", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Nicholas Brealey", "subtitle": "The Principles and Practice of Coaching and Leadership UPDATED 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION", "description": "\"Coaching for Performance is the proven resource for all coaches and pioneers of the future of coaching.\" Magdalena N.

A follow-up to The Functional Art, it goes into the specifics of how to design appealing, credible, and informative infographics and data visualizations. Part 1 in The Truthful Art provides a broad introduction to statistics, written with journalists and designers in mind. Cairo avoids using jargon and formulas, focusing instead on how to manage and interpret data sets, and how to extract stories from them. In Part 2, Cairo gets down to business giving specific advice on how to use charts and maps in infographics and visualization. Readers will learn what kind of statistical charts exist and how to use them correctly; how to talk about maps, with an introduction to cartography terms such as projection, scale, and symbolization; the basics of making maps, including how to create locator maps; and the main kinds of thematic maps (choropleth, isopleth, proportional symbol, etc.) and how to use them. In Part 3, Cairo leaves the classroom and enters the real world with an in-depth look at how information graphics and visualization teams are organized at publications around the world including The New York Times, La Naci\u00f3n (Costa Rica),Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), and more. He also explains how to develop a successful style book for graphics using sample pages from several real style books as examples.

From students developing a research poster to faculty presenting data findings at a conference, Stephanie Evergreen provides the guiding principles of presenting data in evidence-based ways so that audiences are more engaged and researchers are better understood. The book draws on findings from fields like vision science, cognitive psychology, communications, and graphic design and applies them to the everyday reporting and dissemination taking place in higher education and the professional world. Principles related to graphics, color, placement, and typeface are illustrated through before-and-after cases submitted to and developed by the author, primarily using the standard software in Microsoft Office. The Second Edition, now in full color, includes the author's most recent thinking and experience, a review of the recent literature on data visualization, and an improved layout with larger screenshots. Presenting Data Effectively teaches how color and text can be applied with graphics and arranged in such a way that posters, slides, graphs, and reports communicate your data effectively.

Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must. The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps. To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color. \"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"\u2014Scientific American \"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way.

Design thinking is not just applicable to so\u2212called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It\u2032s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente to icnrease the quality of patient care by re\u2212examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change\u201a or Kraft to rethink supply chain management. This is not a book by designers for designers; this is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization\u201a product\u201a or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2009-09-29", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=FGfglgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780061766084&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Change by Design", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Change_by_Design.html?hl=&id=FGfglgEACAAJ", "pageCount": 272, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0061766089", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780061766084", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FGfglgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FGfglgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Tim Brown"], "ratingsCount": 3, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=FGfglgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780061766084&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is not a book by designers for designers; this is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization\u201a product\u201a or service to drive new alternatives for business and society."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "KiW21JwzvMo", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FGfglgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "FGfglgEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FGfglgEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9780465050659", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"subtitle": "Revised and Expanded Edition", "pageCount": 368, "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:9780465050659&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9780465050659", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "0465050654", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things.html?hl=&id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ", "description": "Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious\u2014even liberating\u2014book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how\u2014and why\u2014some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.", "publishedDate": "2013-11-05", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail":

His Pulitzer Prize-winning holocaust memoir Maus established the graphic novel as a legitimate form and inspired countless cartoonists while his shorter works have enormously expanded the expressive range of comics. Co-Mix: A Retrospective of Comics, Graphics, and Scraps is a comprehensive career overview of the output of this legendary cartoonist, showing for the first time the full range of a half-century of relentless experimentation. Starting from Spiegelman's earliest self-published comics and lavishly reproducing graphics from a host of publications both obscure and famous, Co-Mix provides a guided tour of an artist who has continually reinvented not just comics but also made a mark in book and magazine design, bubble gum cards, lithography, modern dance, and most recently stained glass. By showing all facets of Spiegelman's career, the book demonstrates how he has persistently cross-pollinated the worlds of comics, commercial design, and fine arts. Essays by acclaimed film critic J.

The challenge of achieving simplicity requires a lot of creative techniques, including historical review, which asks whether something we traditionally take for granted is still necessary; shedding, where we eliminate what cannot be justified; bulk and exceptions, which deals separately with majority and extreme cases; and reframing, which can make us realise we are seeking solutions to a non-problem. Edward de Bono concludes his thought-provoking study with ten key rules for simplicity, and ground-breaking plans for an Institute of Simplicity and National Simplicity Campaign.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "1999", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=pXkFAQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0140258396&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Simplicity", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Simplicity.html?hl=&id=pXkFAQAACAAJ", "pageCount": 304, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0140258396", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780140258394", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXkFAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXkFAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Edward De Bono"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=pXkFAQAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0140258396&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Lateral thinking"], "averageRating": 5.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Edward de Bono concludes his thought-provoking study with ten key rules for simplicity, and ground-breaking plans for an Institute of Simplicity and National Simplicity Campaign."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "YWW+mv07W0I", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pXkFAQAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "pXkFAQAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/pXkFAQAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "0060391685", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Harper Collins", "subtitle": "Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting", "description": "Robert McKee's screenwriting workshops have earned him an international reputation for inspiring novices, refining works in progress and putting major screenwriting careers back on track.

The result is an extraordinary compilation of nearly 2,000 feats of association that will entertain, educate, and occasionally inspire quotation lovers everywhere. In this intellectual smorgasbord, the author of Oxymoronica and Viva la Repartee explains figurative language in a refreshingly down-to-earth way before taking readers on a tour of history's greatest word pictures.

We must think ahead if we are to cope with the hurricane-force changes now bashing at every aspect of our lives. This acceleration of change brings enormous opportunities as well as great dangers. Most of us know better than to drive down a highway at eighty miles an hour without looking at the road ahead. But when it comes to steering our careers and businesses, we hardly ever consider what?s coming toward us. We often wind up in a nasty ?crash? that we could have avoided if we had better anticipated possible developments. This is where futuring can help. Futuring is the art and science of exploring the future. It offers methods and techniques that can help you understand trends, identify opportunities and avoid dangers. Futuring can help you understand possible future developments, make better decisions, develop worthwhile goals, and find the means to achieve them.

In an internet-enhanced society, according to Richard Susskind and Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers, accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the 'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face interaction. The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's professionals. They argue that our current professions are antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place, they propose five new models for producing and distributing expertise in society. The book raises profound policy issues, not least about employment (they envisage a new generation of 'open-collared workers') and about control over online expertise (they warn of new 'gatekeepers') - in an era when machines become more capable than human beings at most tasks. Based on the authors' in-depth research of more than a dozen professions, and illustrated by numerous examples from each, this is the first book to assess and question the future of the professions in

transformative book on the habits of mind that lead to the best predictions Everyone would benefit from seeing further into the future, whether buying stocks, crafting policy, launching a new product, or simply planning the week's meals. Unfortunately, people tend to be terrible forecasters. As Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed in a landmark 2005 study, even experts' predictions are only slightly better than chance. However, an important and underreported conclusion of that study was that some experts do have real foresight, and Tetlock has spent the past decade trying to figure out why. What makes some people so good? And can this talent be taught? In Superforecasting, Tetlock and coauthor Dan Gardner offer a masterwork on prediction, drawing on decades of research and the results of a massive, government-funded forecasting tournament. The Good Judgment Project involves tens of thousands of ordinary people--including a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer, and a former ballroom dancer--who set out to forecast global events. Some of the volunteers have turned out to be astonishingly good. They've beaten other benchmarks, competitors, and prediction markets. They've even beaten the collective judgment of intelligence analysts with access to classified information. They are \"superforecasters.\" In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group. Weaving together stories of forecasting successes (the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound) and failures (the Bay of Pigs) and interviews with a range of high-level decision makers, from David Petraeus to Robert Rubin, they show that good forecasting doesn't require powerful computers or arcane methods. It involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course. Superforecasting offers the first demonstrably effective way to improve our ability to predict the future--whether in business, finance, politics, international affairs, or daily life--and is destined to become a modern classic.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-09-15", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ICgWrgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780804136693&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Superforecasting", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Superforecasting.html?hl=&id=ICgWrgEACAAJ", "pageCount": 352, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0804136696", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780804136693", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ICgWrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ICgWrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Philip Tetlock", "Dan Gardner"], "ratingsCount": 20, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ICgWrgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780804136693&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "They are &quot;superforecasters.&quot; In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "sD0osbQmWqc", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ICgWrgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "ICgWrgEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ICgWrgEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9780190229238", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "subtitle": "A History", "description": "Selected as a Financial Times Best Book of 2013 In Strategy: A History, Sir Lawrence Freedman, one of the world's leading authorities on war and international politics, captures the vast history of strategic thinking, in a consistently engaging and insightful account of how strategy came to pervade every aspect of our lives. The range of Freedman's narrative is extraordinary, moving from the surprisingly advanced strategy practiced in primate groups, to the opposing strategies of Achilles and Odysseus in The Iliad, the strategic advice of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli, the great military innovations of Baron Henri de Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz, the grounding of revolutionary strategy in class struggles by Marx, the insights into corporate strategy found in Peter Drucker and Alfred Sloan, and the contributions of the leading social scientists working on strategy today. The core issue at the heart of strategy, the author notes, is whether it is possible to manipulate and shape our environment rather than simply become the victim of forces beyond one's control. Time and again, Freedman demonstrates that the inherent unpredictability of this environment-subject to chance events, the efforts of opponents, the missteps of friends-provides strategy with its challenge and its drama. Armies or corporations or nations rarely move from one predictable state of affairs to another, but instead feel their way through a series of states, each one not quite what was anticipated, requiring a reappraisal of the original strategy, including its ultimate objective. Thus the picture of strategy that emerges in this book is one that is fluid and flexible, governed by the starting point, not the end point.

The narrative begins nearly two million years ago with the invention of hand-axes and explores how some of our most cherished notions might have originated before humans had language. Then, in a broad sweep, the book moves forward to consider not the battles and treaties of kings and prime ministers, emperors and generals, but the most important ideas we have evolved, by which we live and which separate us from other animals. Watson explores the first languages and the first words, the birth of the gods, the origins of art, the profound intellectual consequences of money. He describes the invention of writing, early ideas about law, why sacrifice and the soul have proved so enduring in religion. He explains how ideas about time evolved, how numbers were conceived, how science, medicine, sociology, economics, and capitalism came into being. He shows how the discovery of the New World changed forever the way that we think, and why Chinese creativity faded after the Middle Ages. In the course of this commanding narrative, Watson reveals the linkages down the ages in the ideas of many apparently disparate philosophers, astronomers, religious leaders, biologists, inventors, poets, jurists, and scores of others. Aristotle jostles with Aquinas, Ptolemy with Photius, Kalidasa with Zhu Xi, Beethoven with Strindberg, Jefferson with Freud.

education editor Ben Wildavsky presents the first popular account of how international competition for the brightest minds is transforming the world of higher education--and why this revolution should be welcomed, not feared. Every year, nearly three million international students study outside of their home countries, a 40 percent increase since 1999. Newly created or expanded universities in China, India, and Saudi Arabia are competing with the likes of Harvard and Oxford for faculty, students, and research preeminence. Satellite campuses of Western universities are springing up from Abu Dhabi and Singapore to South Africa. Wildavsky shows that as international universities strive to become world-class, the new global education marketplace is providing more opportunities to more people than ever before. Drawing on extensive reporting in China, India, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, Wildavsky chronicles the unprecedented international mobility of students and faculty, the rapid spread of branch campuses, the growth of for-profit universities, and the remarkable international expansion of college rankings. Some university and government officials see the rise of worldwide academic competition as a threat, going so far as to limit student mobility or thwart cross-border university expansion. But Wildavsky argues that this scholarly marketplace is creating a new global meritocracy, one in which the spread of knowledge benefits everyone--both educationally and economically.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2010-04-25", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=fAFEmQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780691146898&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Great Brain Race", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 248, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0691146896", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780691146898", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fAFEmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fAFEmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Ben Wildavsky"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=fAFEmQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780691146898&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Education"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Great_Brain_Race.html?hl=&id=fAFEmQEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In The Great Brain Race, former U.S. News &amp; World Report education editor Ben Wildavsky presents the first popular account of how international competition for the brightest minds is transforming the world of higher education--and why this ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "gwAqDvTXvGY", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fAFEmQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "fAFEmQEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/fAFEmQEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9781451640502", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "subtitle": "The Story of Dungeons & Dragons and The People Who Play It", "description": "This definitive book on Dungeons & Dragons, one of the original ultimate nerd subcultures, traces its origins on the battlefields of ancient Europe through the hysteria that linked it to satanic rituals and teen suicides, and to its apotheosis as father of the modern video game industry.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013-08-20", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NTtoAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781451640502&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Of Dice and Men", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Of_Dice_and_Men.html?hl=&id=NTtoAAAAQBAJ", "pageCount": 276, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9781451640502", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "1451640501", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NTtoAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NTtoAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["David M.

Why we\u2019re addicted to certain websites and steal glances at our smartphones under the dinner table? Or why some people are able to find joy in difficult or repetitive jobs while others burn out? It\u2019s not the experiences themselves but the way they\u2019re structured that matters. All our lives we\u2019ve been told that games are distractions\u2014playful pastimes, but unrelated to success. In Game Frame, Aaron Dignan shows us that the opposite is true: games produce peak learning conditions and accelerated achievement. Here, the crucial connection between the games we love to play and the everyday tasks, goals, and dreams we have trouble realizing is illuminated. Aaron Dignan is the thirty-something founder of a successful digital strategy firm that studies the transformative power of technology in culture. He and his peers were raised on a steady diet of games and gadgets, ultimately priming them to challenge the status quo of the modern workplace. What they learned from games goes deeper than hand-eye coordination; instead, this generation intrinsically understands the value of adding the elements of games into everyday life. Game Frame is the first prescriptive explanation of what games mean to us, the human psychology behind their magnetic pull, and how we can use the lessons they teach as a framework to achieve our potential in business and beyond. Games are a powerful way to influence and change behavior in any setting. Here, Dignan outlines why games and play are such important trends in culture today, and how our technology, from our iPhones to our hybrid cars, primes us to be instinctive players. Game Frame tackles the challenging task of defining games and the mechanics that make games work from several perspectives, then explores these ideas through the lens of neuroscience. Finally, Dignan provides practical tips for using basic game mechanics in a variety of settings, such as motivating employees at work or encouraging children at home, giving readers the tools to develop their own games to solve problems in their everyday lives.

But as Daniel J. Solove argues in this important book, these arguments and many others are flawed. They are based on mistaken views about what it means to protect privacy and the costs and benefits of doing so. The debate between privacy and security has been framed incorrectly as a zero-sum game in which we are forced to choose between one value and the other. Why can't we have both? In this concise and accessible book, Solove exposes the fallacies of many pro-security arguments that have skewed law and policy to favor security at the expense of privacy. Protecting privacy isn't fatal to security measures; it merely involves adequate oversight and regulation. Solove traces the history of the privacy-security debate from the Revolution to the present day. He explains how the law protects privacy and examines concerns with new technologies. He then points out the failings of our current system and offers specific remedies. Nothing to Hide makes a powerful and compelling case for reaching a better balance between privacy and security and reveals why doing so is essential to protect our freedom and democracy\"--Jacket.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=wRUXLgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780300172331&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Nothing to Hide", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 245, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0300172338", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780300172331", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wRUXLgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wRUXLgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Daniel J.

Both have roots in a neglected problem: the resistance of Legacy economic sectors to innovation. While the U.S. has focused its policies on breakthrough innovations to create new economic frontiers like information technology and biotechnology, most of its economy is locked into Legacy sectors defended by technological/ economic/ political/ social paradigms that block competition from disruptive innovations that could challenge their models. Americans like to build technology \"covered wagons\" and take them \"out west\" to open new innovation frontiers; we don't head our wagons \"back east\" to bring innovation to our Legacy sectors. By failing to do so, the economy misses a major opportunity for innovation, which is the bedrock of U.S. competitiveness and its standard of living. Technological Innovation in Legacy Sectors uses a new, unifying conceptual framework to identify the shared features underlying structural obstacles to innovation in major Legacy sectors: energy, air and auto transport, the electric power grid, buildings, manufacturing, agriculture, health care delivery and higher education, and develops approaches to understand and transform them. It finds both strengths and obstacles to innovation in the national innovation environments - a new concept that combines the innovation system and the broader innovation context - for a group of Asian and European economies. Manufacturing is a major Legacy sector that presents a particular challenge because it is a critical stage in the innovation process. By increasingly offshoring production, the U.S. is losing important parts of its innovation capacity. \"Innovate here, produce here,\" where the U.S. took all the gains of its strong innovation system at every stage, is being replaced by \"innovate here, produce there,\" which threatens to lead to \"produce there, innovate there.\" To bring innovation to Legacy sectors, authors William Bonvillian and Charles Weiss recommend that policymakers focus on all stages of innovation from research through implementation. They should fill institutional gaps in the innovation system and take measures to address structural obstacles to needed disruptive innovations. In the specific case of advanced manufacturing, the production ecosystem can be recreated to reverse \"jobless innovation\" and add manufacturing-led innovation to the U.S.'s still-strong, research-oriented innovation system.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-09-15", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=cr8DCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780199374519&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Technological Innovation in Legacy Sectors", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 368, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9780199374519", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "0199374511", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cr8DCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cr8DCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["William B.

In this revolutionary book, Gehl presents his latest work creating (or recreating) cityscapes on a human scale. He clearly explains the methods and tools he uses to reconfigure unworkable cityscapes into the landscapes he believes they should be: cities for people. Taking into account changing demographics and changing lifestyles, Gehl emphasizes four human issues that he sees as essential to successful city planning. He explains how to develop cities that are Lively, Safe, Sustainable, and Healthy. Focusing on these issues leads Gehl to think of even the largest city on a very small scale. For Gehl, the urban landscape must be considered through the five human senses and experienced at the speed of walking rather than at the speed of riding in a car or bus or train. This small-scale view, he argues, is too frequently neglected in contemporary projects. In a final chapter, Gehl makes a plea for city planning on a human scale in the fast- growing cities of developing countries.

Rather than a how to for hands\u2013on techies, the book serves lay readers and experts alike by covering new case studies and the latest state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013art techniques. Prediction is booming. It reinvents industries and runs the world. Companies, governments, law enforcement, hospitals, and universities are seizing upon the power. These institutions predict whether you\u2032re going to click, buy, lie, or die. Why? For good reason: predicting human behavior combats risk, boosts sales, fortifies healthcare, streamlines manufacturing, conquers spam, optimizes social networks, toughens crime fighting, and wins elections. How? Prediction is powered by the world\u2032s most potent, flourishing unnatural resource: data. Accumulated in large part as the by\u2013product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is a gold mine. Big data embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn. Predictive analytics unleashes the power of data. With this technology, the computer literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect prediction is not possible, but putting odds on the future drives millions of decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate. In this lucid, captivating introduction now in its Revised and Updated edition former Columbia University professor and Predictive Analytics World founder Eric Siegel reveals the power and perils of prediction: What type of mortgage risk Chase Bank predicted before the recession Predicting which people will drop out of school, cancel a subscription, or get divorced before they even know it themselves Why early retirement predicts a shorter life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights Five reasons why organizations predict death including one health insurance company How U.S. Bank and Obama for America calculated and Hillary for America 2016 plans to calculate the way to most strongly persuade each individual Why the NSA wants all your data: machine learning supercomputers to fight terrorism How IBM\u2032s Watson computer used predictive modeling to answer questions and beat the human champs on TV\u2032s Jeopardy! How companies ascertain untold, private truths how Target figures out you\u2032re pregnant and Hewlett\u2013Packard deduces you\u2032re about to quit your job How judges and parole boards rely on crime\u2013predicting computers to decide how long convicts remain in prison 183 examples from Airbnb, the BBC, Citibank, ConEd, Facebook, Ford, Google, the IRS, LinkedIn, Match.com, MTV, Netflix, PayPal, Pfizer, Spotify, Uber, UPS, Wikipedia, and more How does predictive analytics work? This jam\u2013packed book satisfies by demystifying the intriguing science under the hood.

From oil wars to SMS texting, from airport expansion controversies to the decline of walking, from slave\u2013trading to global terrorism, from global warming to teleworking, issues of \u2032mobility\u2032 are centre\u2013stage upon many academic and policy agendas. These topics and issues are increasingly analysed as part of a concern with \u2032mobility\u2032 which this wide\u2013ranging book both describes and seeks to develop. John Urry has been at the centre of these debates and he draws upon an extensive array of new research and material to develop what he calls the \u2032new mobilities paradigm\u2032 for the social sciences. He shows how this paradigm makes comprehensible social phenomena which were previously opaque. He examines how \u2032mobilities\u2032 each presuppose a \u2032system\u2032 that permits predictable and relatively risk\u2013free repetition. The book outlines various such systems and then analyses their intersecting implications for social inequality, for social networks and meetings, for the nature of places and for alternative mobility futures. Mobilities is thus both an analysis of different mobilities historically and in the present and an argument that the social world will be analysed quite differently once peoples\u2032 lives, organisations, states and global institutions are seen to be dealing with extensive and hugely contested mobility processes.

The skills required to re-enchant the city are far wider than the conventional ones like architecture, engineering and land-use planning.

The vision for 21st century cities must be to be the most imaginative cities for the world rather than in the world.

It helps cities become places of solidarity where the relations between the individual, the group, outsiders to the city and the planet are in better alignment.

At the heart of Sen's argument is his insistence on the role of public reason in establishing what can make societies less unjust. But it is in the nature of reasoning about justice, argues Sen, that it does not allow all questions to be settled even in theory; there are choices to be faced between alternative assessments of what is reasonable. Sen also shows how concern about the principles of justice in the modern world must avoid parochialism, and further, address questions of global injustice.

Do tax cuts for business owners really stimulate employment? Why shouldn't we just leave everything to the market? And why do we all save so little? Discover the answers to these and many more questions. With his trademark plain-speaking wit and insight, Robert Frank shows through dozens of examples how our personal choices about everything from paying for food and housing to large-scale policy decisions about taxation and the regulation of markets all boil down to the same simple economic principles, often resulting in the same wasteful mistakes. He shows that while our desires may be boundless, the resources necessary to satisfy them remain limited and argues that choices are always best made pragmatically - by carefully weighing the costs and benefits of competing options.

In his exciting saga, Isaacson begins with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter, who pioneered computer programming in the 1840s. He then explores the fascinating personalities that created our current digital revolution, such as Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, Tim Berners-Lee and Larry Page. This is the story of how their minds worked and what made them so creative.

The product of a twenty-five year, multi-million pound effort to identify the most prevalent human talents, the StrengthsFinder programme introduces thirty-four talents or \"themes\" and reveals how they can best be translated into personal and career success. Each copy of the book contains a unique password that gives the reader access to the StrengthsFinder Profile, a Web-based interview that analyses people's instinctive reactions and immediately presents them with their five most dominant strengths. Once readers know which of the thirty-four talent themes dominates their personality, they can make practical applications at three levels: as an individual, as a manager and within an organisation. Readers learn what kind of environments will allow them to flourish; how managers can better cultivate their employers' talents; and how almost all organisations inhibit the talents of their people and need to change.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2002", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=V2xNPgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0743207661&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Now, Discover Your Strengths", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Now_Discover_Your_Strengths.html?hl=&id=V2xNPgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 260, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0743207661", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780743207669", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V2xNPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V2xNPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Marcus Buckingham", "Donald O.

In this chaotic world of teams, matrix management, and horizontal organizations, it's tougher than ever to get things done. How do you lead when you're not the one in charge? How can you be effective when joint action is needed? You need an edge in order to reach solutions and effectively work with others. Getting It DONE is your edge. Cowritten by Roger Fisher, an acknowledged authority on negotiation, Getting It DONE is the book to help you make things happen when you're not the boss. Fisher is the man who redefined the way the world negotiates with his megabestseller Getting to YES. Now he has teamed up with management consultant Alan Sharp to move beyond negotiation and give us the definitive book on collaboration. Introducing the technique of lateral leadership, Fisher and Sharp take collaboration to the next level and offer surefire ways to help anyone get better results from coworkers. Gleaned from their decades of experience as negotiators, mediators, and consultants to organizations, Getting It DONE gives you the practical tools you need to influence your peers and bosses and get the results you seek. Getting It DONE explains how you can best help a group formulate a clear vision of the results they want, suggest a course of action that you can all implement, and learn from past experiences. It describes how to ask questions effectively, offer ideas that will be heard, and influence the actions of others through your own behavior. The invaluable skills of lateral leadership enable you to achieve the ultimate goal--successful collaboration: Diagnose: identify the causes of a problem in order to solve it Prescribe: create an approach that deals effectively with differences Lead: engage others to implement the plan A simple guide with profound impact, Getting It DONE will help people effectively manage themselves and others well into the twenty-first century.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "1997-06-03", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=WeqSQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0887308422&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Getting It Done", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Getting_It_Done.html?hl=&id=WeqSQgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 240, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0887308422", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780887308420", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WeqSQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WeqSQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Roger Fisher", "Alan Sharp"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=WeqSQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0887308422&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 2.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Getting It DONE is your edge.

Is Western civilisation universal? Does the West promote human rights for altruistic reasons? These are some questions Kishore Mahbuybani has sought to answer in this volume of essays written over the past decade. Contrary to the prevailing view in the West that the 500-year dominance of Western civilisation points to it being the only universal civilisations, this book argues that other civilisations may yet make equal contributions to the development and growth of mankind. Hailed as 'an Asian Toynbee', and 'the Max Weber of the new Confucian ethic', Mahbubani continues to illuminate his central arguments with new essays in this third edition.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0dneQOzDlz4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9812327894&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Can Asians Think?", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Can_Asians_Think.html?hl=&id=0dneQOzDlz4C", "pageCount": 264, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "2.1.0.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9812327894", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9789812327895", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0dneQOzDlz4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0dneQOzDlz4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Kishore Mahbubani"], "ratingsCount": 4, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0dneQOzDlz4C&dq=isbn:9812327894&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Asia"], "averageRating": 3.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "No Marketing Blurb"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "FkcXnzGSts8", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0dneQOzDlz4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": true, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "PARTIAL", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE"}, "id": "0dneQOzDlz4C", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0dneQOzDlz4C"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9789810912888", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"language": "en", "publishedDate": "2008", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=MkpDnQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9789810912888&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Adrian Teo Presents The Resident Tourist", "printType": "BOOK", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "OCLC:702553706", "type": "OTHER"}], "authors": ["Troy Chin"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=MkpDnQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9789810912888&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Cartoonists"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Adrian_Teo_Presents_The_Resident_Tourist.html?hl=&id=MkpDnQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "tnQcYTnBMsM", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MkpDnQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "MkpDnQEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/MkpDnQEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9789810592103", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Monsoon Books Pte Limited", "description": "The Great Singapore Quiz is the ultimate compendium for trivia buffs.

Published in 1997, the bestselling Buffettology was written specifically for investors in the midst of a long bull market. Since then we've seen the internet bubble burst, the collapse of Enron, and investors scrambling to move their assets -- what remains of them -- back to the safety of traditional blue chip companies. As price peaks turned into troughs, worried investors wondered if there was any constant in today's volatile market. The answer is yes: Warren Buffett's value investing strategies make money. The New Buffettology is the first guide to Warren Buffett's selective contrarian investment strategy for exploiting down stocks -- a strategy that has made him the nation's second-richest person. Designed to teach investors how to decipher and use financial information the way Buffett himself does, this book guides investors through opportunity-rich bear markets, walking them step-by-step through the equations and formulas Buffett uses to determine what to buy, what to sell -- and when. Authors Mary Buffett and David Clark explore Buffett's recent investments in detail, proving time and again that his strategy has earned enormous profits at a time no one expects them to -- and with almost zero risk to his capital. In short, The New Buffettology is an essential companion to the original Buffettology, a road map to investment success in the worst of times.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2002-09-24", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=9FGfmAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0684871742&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The New Buffettology", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Buffettology.html?hl=&id=9FGfmAEACAAJ", "pageCount": 288, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0684871742", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780684871745", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9FGfmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9FGfmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Mary Buffett", "David Clark"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=9FGfmAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0684871742&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The New Buffettology is the first guide to Warren Buffett&#39;s selective contrarian investment strategy for exploiting down stocks -- a strategy that has made him the nation&#39;s second-richest person."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "ou4qvX6EmAA", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9FGfmAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "9FGfmAEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9FGfmAEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9889776928", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"subtitle": "Harness the Investment Genius of the World's Richest Investors", "description": "The mental habits and strategies that Warren Buffett and George Soros both practice fly in the face of the conventional Wall Street \"wisdom\": Buffett and Soros don't diversify.

They're not focused on the profits they expect to make. Indeed, they're not investing for the money at all. They don't believe that to make big profits you must take big risks. Indeed, both are far more focused on not losing money than on making it. Investment success lies in your mental habits and strategies, says Mark Tier in this path-breaking book. In identifying the winning investment habits that led Warren Buffett and George Soros to phenomenal success, Mark Tier has uncovered for the first time the habits that ALL successful investors share. Every one of these winning habits is something you can easily learn yourself. And it makes no difference whether you look for stock market bargains like Warren Buffett, trade currency futures like George Soros, invest in real estate, antiques or collectibles, use technical analysis, buy on dips or buy on breakouts, use a computerized trading system - or just want to salt money away safely for a rainy day.

The shifting international economic relations from capital rich states gives them new power in influencing the global agenda. Despite controlling trillions of dollars in the biggest companies in the world, little is known about the opaque funds of oil rich and non-democratic governments. This is the first book to compile a history of sovereign wealth funds recounting the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority's involvement with the scandal-plagued BCCI bank and Chinese arms exports to Iran. By constructing a history within the proper context of oil-driven surpluses and large inflationary pressures with no international investment framework, this book explains the development and growth of sovereign wealth funds. The economics of capital surplus countries and investment strategies are examined in order to better understand sovereign wealth fund creation and growth.

Their new text is a very welcome addition to the development literature.' - Christopher M. Dent, University of Leeds, UK In this book Gavin Peebles and Peter Wilson offer an historical overview of the rapid growth and development of the Singapore economy, detailing the institutions and policies which have made this growth possible. They examine the current state of the economy and its future in terms of prospective growth and structural change. the authors discuss the conflicting views on the role of government and the public sector in the economy, and analyse the quality and sustainability of growth. They explore the structural changes which have occurred due to high rates of savings and investment, a large balance of payments surplus and monetary, financial and fiscal conditions. Important in this analysis is the extent to which Singaporeans themselves have benefited in terms of welfare. the authors also identify the key roles played by trade policy, and financial and exchange rate institutions in creating and sustaining growth. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, they assess the current health of the economy and the implementation of reforms to achieve the government's vision of a 'New Singapore'.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2002-01-01", "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=15jipgI09x8C&dq=isbn:1843760525&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Economic Growth and Development in Singapore", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 328, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.0.1.0.preview.2", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1843760525", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781843760528", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=15jipgI09x8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=15jipgI09x8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Gavin Peebles", "Peter Wilson"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=15jipgI09x8C&dq=isbn:1843760525&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Economic_Growth_and_Development_in_Singa.html?hl=&id=15jipgI09x8C"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In this book Gavin Peebles and Peter Wilson offer an historical overview of the rapid growth and development of the Singapore economy, detailing the institutions and policies which have made this growth possible."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "iQCwLeAQI68", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=15jipgI09x8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": true}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "15jipgI09x8C", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/15jipgI09x8C"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "0195887670", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "description": "The book discusses Singapore's public policies, calling attention to the need to refocus on the politics of the policy making process, while discussing the political nature of policy making.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2000-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=R2q6AAAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0195887670&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Politics of Policy-making in Singapore", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 258, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0195887670", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780195887679", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R2q6AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R2q6AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Khai Leong Ho"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=R2q6AAAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0195887670&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["History"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Politics_of_Policy_making_in_Singapo.html?hl=&id=R2q6AAAAIAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book discusses Singapore&#39;s public policies, calling attention to the need to refocus on the politics of the policy making process, while discussing the political nature of policy making."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "AqqLYs9jn3w", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=R2q6AAAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "R2q6AAAAIAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/R2q6AAAAIAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "9789971697723", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "NUS Press", "subtitle": "Old Tensions, New Discoveries", "description": "Changing Landscapes of Singapore illuminates both the social and the physical terrains of modern Singapore.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth\u2013highest per capita real income? The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes. Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city\u2013state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time. Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial\u2013era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport. In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always \"to be correct, not politically correct.\" Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: \"If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.\" Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry\u2013spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping. Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children \u2013\u2013 particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister. For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics.

It is full of human insights, and it has a deep understanding of successful leadership, an appreciation of selflessness as the key to our collective future, an awareness of history's relevance to our lives and an unflinching emphasis on excellence. Siong Guan Lim is one of the most outstanding public servants in any country, and after finishing this book, you will know why.\" Senator Bill Bradley Former U.S. Senator and a Managing Director at Allen & Co. United States of America \"The Leader, the Teacher and You is a riveting and thoughtful study on leadership based on theory, principles, and experience by a former Head of the Civil Service and one of Singapore's most successful and admired public servants, Siong Guan Lim. It should be read by every student of politics and public policy, and anyone who aspires to play a leadership role. The book, which as the author says is \"part biography, part commentary, and part exposition\", is loaded with insights into how to work with people, deal with reality, motivate an organisation, achieve results, anticipate change, and ensure relevance of the organisation. For those who have long puzzled over how Singapore has been able to achieve so much with so little and in short time, it is public servants such as Siong Guan Lim who have made the partnership between the civil service and the elected politicians so fruitful. Through his fascinating account of how he started in his first job as an engineer in the Sewerage Department, went on to be the Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, worked with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Dr Goh Keng Swee, and became successively Permanent Secretary of Defence, Education, and Finance, he recounts the crucial mentorship and inspiration provided by Singapore's leaders. He thoroughly examines what true leadership is all about. Lim moved on to become Chairman of Singapore's Economic Development Board and then Group President of GIC Private Limited, the wealth fund of Singapore. I have not read such a clear analysis of the function of leadership written so succinctly and in such practical terms. It should be on the required reading list of university courses not only in Singapore, but major universities everywhere.\" Professor Chan Heng Chee Chairman, Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities Singapore University of Technology and Design Singapore \"A remarkable book\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6after I started reading it I simply couldn't put it down. It has great insights, is fun to read, and deserves to be widely read. It is full of practical wisdom for a wide range of people - from full time mums to business leaders. It sets out a framework for leaders based on values and culture, but also on lessons learned by having to take tough decisions. Siong Guan Lim had an outstanding career in the development of Singapore. The ability, motivation, and vision of the author and his colleagues are clearly one reason why Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew were so successful. Because of this the book is a great insight to understanding the phenomenon of Singapore.\" Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach>BR>Vice Chairman, Goldman Sachs International United Kingdom \"Siong Guan Lim has led and managed at the most senior levels of the Singaporean government. Any leader would love to have him at his/her side, advising, counselling, provoking, and reminding. We cannot have him with us in person, but we do have this book that extracts the lessons that he has garnered from his many years of experience. We are fortunate that he has chosen to share his wisdom in writing. I have used some of his wisdom in my Harvard Kennedy School course on Effective Implementation for more than ten years.

Because there is a structural disconnect between revenue and expenses in the nonprofit world. Is continuous growth the hallmark of a successful charity? No, it\u2019s just the opposite\u2014the ultimate aim of a charity is to be extinct. Would you use volunteers if it actually cost more than hiring paid skilled staff? Yes, if engagement with the community is crucial. Call these examples, ironies, paradoxes or simply insights into why the charity sector is what it is. Doing Good Well is a thinking man\u2019s guide to the nonprofit world. It is replete with nonprofit paradigms. It provides a different twist to what one might regard as straightforward notions such as mission, staff compensation, governance and corporate social responsibility. And it surprises and challenges even as it seeks to explain charity-specific issues such as charitableness, bridging the rich/poor divide, informed giving and social entrepreneurship. And as he deconstructs existing paradigms, Willie Cheng creates new ones. Through an easy writing style, hearty anecdotes and thought-provoking perspectives, Cheng engages the readers with a strategic review of not just the status quo but also the enormous potential in the nonprofit world. The theme of the book is change. Inasmuch as charities are about changing society for the better, this book seeks to set the stage for interesting introspection. Whether you are a volunteer, business executive, nonprofit worker, governor or regulator, it\u2019s time to start asking the questions that would help the charity sector itself change for the better.

Seduced by market size, the illusion of a borderless, \u201cflat\u201d world, and the allure of similarities, firms launch one-size-fits-all strategies. But cross-border differences are larger than we often assume, explains Pankaj Ghemawat in Redefining Global Strategy. Most economic activity\u2014including direct investment, tourism, and communication\u2014happens locally, not internationally. In this \u201csemiglobalized\u201d world, one-size-fits-all strategies don\u2019t stand a chance. Companies must instead reckon with cross-border differences. Ghemawat shows you how\u2014by providing tools for: \u00b7 Assessing the cultural, administrative, geographic, and economic differences between countries at the industry level and deciding which ones merit attention. \u00b7 Tracking the implications of particular border-crossing moves for your company\u2019s ability to create value. \u00b7 Creating superior performance with strategies optimized for adaptation (adjusting to differences), aggregation (overcoming differences), and arbitrage (exploiting differences), and for compound objectives. In-depth examples reveal how companies such as Cemex, Toyota, Procter & Gamble, Tata Consultancy Services, IBM, and GE Healthcare have adroitly managed cross-border differences\u2014as well as how other well-known companies have failed at this challenge.

Porter's Competitive Strategy has transformed the theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world. Electrifying in its simplicity -- like all great breakthroughs -- Porter's analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus -- which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter's framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new discipline of competitor assessment. More than a million managers in both large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter's ideas and applied them to assess industries, understand competitors,, and choose competitive positions. The ideas in the book address the underlying fundamentals of competition in a way that is independent of the specifics of the ways companies go about competing. Competitive Strategy has filled a void in management thinking. It provides an enduring foundation and grounding point on which all subsequent work can be built. By bringing a disciplined structure to the question of how firms achieve superior profitability, Porter's rich frameworks and deep insights comprise a sophisticated view of competition unsurpassed in the last quarter-century.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003-12-26", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ia-vQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0743260880&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Competitive Strategy", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Competitive_Strategy.html?hl=&id=ia-vQgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 432, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0743260880", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780743260886", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ia-vQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ia-vQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Michael E.

Its opening question remains as pressing as ever: How should knowledge production be organised. The second edition contains a substantial new introduction, in which Fuller reflects on social epistemology's place in the history of analytic and continental epistemology and discusses the inspiration he has drawn from a wide variety of fields in the humanities and social sciences. It also includes a spirited attack on alternative philosophical groundings for social epistemology and a detailed response to the standard criticism that social epistemology has received from realist philosophers and natural scientists during the \"Science Wars.\" InSocial EpistemologyFuller seeks to reconcile normative philosophy of science and empirical sociology of knowledge. He reinterprets key problems in the philosophy of science, such as realism, the nature of objectivity, the demarcation of science from other disciplines, and the nature of our knowledge of other times and places. In the course of this reinterpretation, which draws on concepts and arguments from many branches of the humanities and social sciences, Fuller considers such philosophically neglected questions as: How is the burden of proof determined in science? On what basis is the historian licensed to say that a \"consensus\" has been reached on a scientific claim? What implications do our patently imperfect means of linguistic transmission have for the notion that science \"retains and accumulates\" knowledge? Finally, Fuller proposes a course of \"Knowledge Policy Studies\" designed to make the theory of knowledge a branch of political theory and thereby to hasten the evolution of the epistemologist into a knowledge policy maker. In its new edition, the book remains a provocative contribution to the debate on the production, dissemination, and interpretation of knowledge in the sciences.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2002", "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=VJW-ZG63zf0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0253215153&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Social Epistemology", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 314, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0253215153", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780253215154", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VJW-ZG63zf0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VJW-ZG63zf0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Steve Fuller"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=VJW-ZG63zf0C&dq=isbn:0253215153&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Philosophy"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Epistemology.html?hl=&id=VJW-ZG63zf0C"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot;&quot; --Isis This is the book that launched the research program of social epistemology, which has fueled imaginations and provoked debates across many disciplines around the world."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "SG", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "e3L3bz7QjPM", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VJW-ZG63zf0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": true, "country": "SG", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "PARTIAL", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com.sg/books/download/Social_Epistemology-sample-epub.acsm?id=VJW-ZG63zf0C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE"}, "id": "VJW-ZG63zf0C", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VJW-ZG63zf0C"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}}, {"no_dash_isbn": "0750672226", "response": {"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Routledge", "subtitle": "Foundations and Applications", "description": "Social capital - the informal networks, trust and common understanding among individuals in an organization - determines major competitive advantages in today's networked economy.

They give Henry a new name, Aniday, and the gift of agelessness - now and forever, he will be seven years old. The group has left another child in Henry's place. This changeling boy, who has morphed himself into Henry's duplicate, must adjust to a new way of life and hide his true identity from the Day family.

D. Salinger's world-famous novel of disaffected youth. Holden Caulfield is a seventeen- year-old dropout who has just been kicked out of his fourth school. Navigating his way through the challenges of growing up, Holden dissects the 'phony' aspects of society, and the 'phonies' themselves: the headmaster whose affability depends on the wealth of the parents, his roommate who scores with girls using sickly-sweet affection.Written with the clarity of a boy leaving childhood behind, The Catcher in the Rye explores the world with disarming frankness and a warm, affecting charisma which has made this novel a universally loved classic of twentieth-century literature.J. D. Salinger was born in 1919 and died in January 2010. He grew up in New York City, and wrote short stories from an early age, but his breakthrough came in 1948 with the publication in The New Yorker of 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish'. The Catcher in the Rye was his first and only novel, published in 1951. It remains one of the most translated, taught and reprinted texts, and has sold some 65 million copies.

It is also the gripping story of how a member of the inner circle of this enigmatic country became its most courageous, outspoken critic. Jang Jin-sung held one of the most senior ranks in North Korea's propaganda machine, helping tighten the regime's grip over its people. Among his tasks were developing the founding myth of North Korea, posing undercover as a South Korean intellectual and writing epic poems in support of the dictator, Kim Jong-il. Young and ambitious, his patriotic work secured him a bizarre audience with Kim Jong-il himself, thus granting him special status as one of the 'Admitted'. This meant special food provisions, a travel pass and immunity from prosecution and harm. He was privy to state secrets, including military and diplomatic policies, how the devastating 'Scrutiny' was effected, and the real position of one of the country's most powerful, elusive men, Im Tong-ok. Because he was praised by the Dear Leader himself, he had every reason to feel satisfied with his lot and safe. Yet he could not ignore his conscience, or the disparity between his life and that of those he saw starving on the street. After breaking security rules, Jang Jin-sung, together with a close friend, was forced to flee for his life: away from lies and deceit, towards truth and freedom.", "language": "en", "publishedDate":

A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years-from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding-that puts the violence, fear, hope and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives-the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness-are inextricable from the history playing out around them. Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship.

To Abdullah, Pari, as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named, is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection. Each night they sleep together in their cot, their skulls touching, their limbs tangled. One day the siblings journey across the desert to Kabul with their father. Pari and Abdullah have no sense of the fate that awaits them there, for the event which unfolds will tear their lives apart; sometimes a finger must be cut to save the hand. Crossing generations and continents, moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos, Khaled Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, and how the

'My name is August. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.' Auggie wants to be an ordinary ten-year-old. He does ordinary things - eating ice cream, playing on his Xbox. He feels ordinary - inside. But ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. Ordinary kids aren't stared at wherever they go. Born with a terrible facial abnormality, Auggie has been home-schooled by his parents his whole life. Now, for the first time, he's being sent to a real school - and he's dreading it. All he wants is to be accepted - but can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, underneath it all?

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy? When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasnt about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.
